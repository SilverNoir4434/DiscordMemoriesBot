# DiscordMemoriesBot
Discord bot that posts links to pinned messages on the anniversary of the message being posted.

To setup the bot, follow the instructions here to set up a bot account on Discord: https://dsharpplus.github.io/DSharpPlus/articles/basics/bot_account.html
After you've done that, invite the bot to your server and make sure it has the "Manage Channels" permission and all intents.
Then, make a channel in your Discord server called memories-channel and make sure the bot can see it.
Finally, run the !setup command and do as the bot asks! After that, it should work on its own.
